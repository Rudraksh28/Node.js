URL -> Unifrom Resource Locator



Sure, let's simplify these HTTP methods:

GET: Think of it like asking for something. You use GET when you want to retrieve data from a server. For example, when you open a webpage in your browser, it's like sending a GET request to the server to get that page's content.

POST: This is like submitting information. You use POST when you want to send data to the server to create something new. It's like filling out a form online and clicking 'submit' to send your information to the server.

PUT: Imagine you have a toy and you want to replace it with a new one. PUT is like saying, "Here's the new one, please replace the old one with this." You use PUT to send data to the server to replace an existing resource entirely.

PATCH: If you have a piece of clothing with a small tear and you want to fix just that part, you'd use a patch. PATCH is similar. It's like saying, "Here's a small change, please apply it to the existing resource." You use PATCH to make partial updates to a resource.

DELETE: This one's straightforward. DELETE is like saying, "I want this gone." You use DELETE to ask the server to remove a resource entirely.
